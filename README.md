# Pong


![A game of Pong](screenshots/pong%200.png)

In 1972, Atari released Pong, a table-tennis inspired arcade title. The game was originally a training excercise assigned to Allan Alcorn.

In the spirit of training exercises, I decided to give it a try myself. Thus, this project was born.

50 years late to the party, here's Pong again!
